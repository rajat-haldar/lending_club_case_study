## General Information
- The assigment is a EDA methodolgy that uses the lending club data set to analyse whether a loan will be defaulted or not.
- This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface.
- The Lending company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
- One CSV file 'loan,csv' conataing loan data excluding rejected loan application is used for the case study.
