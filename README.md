## General Information

### Project Information
- The assigment is based on EDA methodolgy that uses the lending club data set to analyse whether a loan will be defaulted or not.

### Project Background
- This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. Like most other lending companies, lending loans to risky applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'.

### Project Statement
- The Lending company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

### Data Set
- One CSV file 'loan.csv' conataing loan data excluding rejected loan application is used for the case study.

## Conclusions
- Driving factors (or driver variables) which are strong indicators of default:

1. DTI 
2. Grades
3. Interest Rate
4. Annual income
5. public record bankruptcies 
6. Employment Length 
7. Loan Term

- Other observation on the loan dataset:

1. Borrowers with more annual income, having less public record of Bankruptcy.
2. Borrowers having more Public Recorded Bankruptcy are more prone for defaulting.
3. Borrowers with lower grades like E,F,G are likely to default.
4. Very high Debt to Income value ratio are more likely to default.
